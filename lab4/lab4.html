      <p>I'm Khant Ti Kyi, a 17-year-old international student from Myanmar currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Humber College. My passion for technology began at a young age, and I have always been fascinated by how computer systems work. I aim to leverage my skills in cybersecurity to secure positions in prominent banks like Scotiabank and CIBC in the future. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for positive change, and I aspire to contribute to that change through my work.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of graphic design, where I find joy in creating visually appealing content. Experimenting with Photoshop allows me to unleash my creativity, whether I'm designing logos or creating digital artwork. I'm also passionate about sports, particularly basketball, which keeps me active and helps me develop teamwork and leadership skills. Cooking is another hobby I cherish; I love experimenting with different cuisines and sharing my creations with friends and family. Gaming is a great way for me to unwind and connect with others, as I enjoy both competitive and cooperative games.
